#it requires PyAudio to work and for the working of Pyaudio it requires portaudio to be installed

01.sudo dnf install portaudio #yes it is depended on package manager acoording to your distro 

02.pip install PyAudio #pyaudio installation

#if the pyaudio doesnt install you can download manually and install it using:

03.python setup.py build 

#it may show error like "Python.h: No such file or directory". That means you have to install headers properly for python

04.sudo dnf install python3-devel #install the lacking headers for python and this is for fedora and rhel distros ie distro depended command

05.sudo dnf install portaudio-devel # same for header installation for portaudio

# 03, 04 and 05 are only needed for manua pyaudio installatiom

#Last and final 

pip install speechrecognition

#and it is done for immrdiate testing


python -m speech_recognition #it starts its work
